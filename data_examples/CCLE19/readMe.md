## CCLE 2019

Expanded characterizations of CCLE cancer cell lines. This includes RNA sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, reverse-phase protein array, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, microRNA expression profiling, global histone modification profiling, and metabolomics.

Processed data downloads are available here. Raw sequencing data is available through the Sequence Read Archive under accession number PRJNA523380: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=PRJNA523380 .
