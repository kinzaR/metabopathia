here's quite a good tutorial here

Essentially you just run the notebook on the remote in no browser mode.

jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8080

Then setup an ssh tunnel from the local machine:

ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 <REMOTE_USER>@<REMOTE_HOST>

Then in your local browser go to: http://localhost:8080/
EDIT:

Running on a specific port is not necessary. The --no-browser tag is.
